Operations performed on strings:
--------------------------------
Length		Finds the length of the string.
Copy		Copies the contents of one string to another string.
Concatenate	Appends one string at the end of another string.
Compare		Compares two strings and find whether they are identical or not.


Brute Force Algorithm:
----------------------
Used for pattern matching.
Alg:
The string 's' in which the pattern string is to be searched is scanned char by
char. Beginning from 0th char of string 's', each char is compared with each and
every char of the pattern string 'p'. This process continues till either there
is no mismatch or the pattern string 'p' is not exhausted.
If a match is found then the index of char of 's' from which the comparison
began is returned as the position where the pattern string 'p' is found.
If there is mismatch then next char of string 's' is considered and there
onwards again it is compared with the chars of the pattern string 'p'.
The process ends either when a match is found or when the number of chars in the
string 's' that remain to be scanned is less than the total number of chars in
the pattern string 'p'.

eg:
s = "NagpurKicit"
p = "Kicit"

The pattern string "Kicit" is found at postion 6 in given string "NagpurKicit".
