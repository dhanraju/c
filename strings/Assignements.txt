1. Write a program using Brute-Force algorithm to search for a pattern string in
a text where the text is scanned from right to left.
2. Write a program to delete a sub-string of given string. For example if the
string is 'What is life' and sub-string to be deleted is 'life' then first check
if sub-string 'life' is present in the string and if present then delete it.
3. Write a program, which deletes all the blank spaces except a single space

the program should return a string as "No pains, No gains".
4. Write a program which counts number of words, lines and characters in a given
text.
5. Write a program to implement find and replace utility. The program should ask
the user to enter two words, one to be searched and the other to be replace the
searched word.
6. Write a program to count the occurrences fo character 'e' in the following
array of pointers to strings.

char *s[] = {
