1. Write a program to find out the maximum and second maximum number from an
array of integers.
2. Write a program that accepts a number as input in English languaae format
such as One Twenty Three (for 123) and prints the decimal form of it.
3. The Mode of an array of numbers is the number 'm' in the array that is
repeated most frequently. If more than one number is repeated with equal maximal
frequencies, there is no mode. Write a program that accepts an array of numbers
and returns the mode or an indication that the mode does not exist.
4. Write a program to delete duplicate elements from an array of 20 integers.
5. A square matrix is called symmetric if for all values of i and j a[i][j] =
a[j][i]. Write a proram, which verifies whether a given 5x5 matrix is symmetric,
or not.
6. There are two arrays A and B. A contains 25 elements, whereas, B contains 30
elements. Write a function to create an array C that contains only those
elements that are common to A and B.
7. A magic square of 5 rows x5 columns contains different elements. Write a
function to verify whether the sum of each individual column elements, sum of
each individual row elements and sum of diagonal elements is equal or not.
8. Usuallya polynomial is stored in an arry with exponents of each term in
decreasing order. Write a procedure to reverse this order, so that now the terms
are arranged in increasing order.
