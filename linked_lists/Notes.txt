For storing similar data in memory we can use either an array of a linked list.
But arrays have following limitations:
- Arrays havbe fixed dimension. So, its size cannot be increased or decreased
  during execution.
- Array elemets are always stored in contiguous memory locations. At times, it
  is not allowed to create the array though enough non-contiguous blocks of
  memory is available.
- Operations like insertion or deletion of an element is tedious.

Linked lists store similar data in memory in non-contiguous. So, overcomes above
limitations.

Operations on linked lists:
---------------------------
Append at End.
Add at Beginning.
Add after.
Display.
Count of nodes.
Delete a node.
